a = 5
b = 6
print(a & b)  # perform bit by bit and operation
print(a | b)  # perform bit by or and operation
print(a ^ b)  # perform bit by xor and operation
print(~a)  # perform complement
print(a << b)  # perform left shift operation. shifting by 1 is equal to multiplying by 2
print(a >> b)  # perform right shift operation. shifting by 1 is equal to dividing by 2
